0.13.2f:
Integrated Russian translation by KiriX

0.13.2e:
- Fixed searchloop at Guildmerchants (although they are still not really supported by the addon. No history, etc.)
- Implemented possible workaround for numerical conversion errors:
		Items wich would cause those errors will be ignored and not added to searchresults or history.
